                This page contains scans of handwritten solutions to MIT's OCW 8.962 graduate course on 
                General Relativity. During the time before starting my PhD, I wanted to gain a better understanding
                of G.R. as I was interested in pursuing numerical relativity as my subspecialty in graduate school. I worked
                my way through the lecture series available on YouTube as well as the 11 problem sets, and I have
                posted those scans here.
            </p>
            <p>
                I do not guarantee that all of the answers I have provided are correct, and I could not find any resources
                online that had solutions of their own or were able to validate my own answers. I am providing these solutions
                since I think if you are a student studying the subject and are stuck, a hint can always come in handy and 
                often aids in understanding the material rather than re-inforcing logical inconsistencies if you are unable to check
                your work. I do not encourage blatantly copying these solutions as that will not lead to any knowledge gain. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you find something that seems incorrect in these solutions, please email me and I will do my best to update
                or correct anything that is wrong. I encourage skepticism of my solutions since I think you and I can both learn 
                from a careful eye. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I would eventually like to neatly format these solutions in LaTeX rather than the handwritten scans that are
                currently posted here, but that may be aways into the future.
