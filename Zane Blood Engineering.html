                <p>
                    Welcome to the personal website of Zane Blood! 
                    I recently graduated in 2023 with a bachelor's degree in physics from the College of Arts
                    and Sciences at Cornell Universiy in Ithaca, New York. At Cornell, I worked in the lab of 
                    Dr. Jared Maxson and the Center for Bright Beams where I developed diagnostics for the group's ultra
                    fast electron diffraction accelerator.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently working as a fullstack software developer at Epic Systems in Verona, Wisconsin. During my time in 
                    physics I realized my love for algorithms and computer science. I want to continue applying the web development and
                    backend skills I have learned to help optimize the user and customer experience of large businesses and organizations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please feel free to contact me and I thank you for taking the time to visit my site and encourage you to check out
                    the links to my personal coding projects or other media. Links to my GitHub repositories, YouTube channel,
