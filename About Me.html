                <p>
                    Although I was born in Hawaii, I grew up in Ashland, Oregon where I 
                    attended Ashland High School and began to foster my love for all things
                    science. Back then I was just getting interested in hardware and experiment and built
                    a few home projects from scratch like a Tesla coil and a Hoffman Apparatus. Videos of
                    these experiments can be found on the older uploads of my YouTube channel. I algo got involved
                    in amateur radio during my junior year of high school when I got my general class license.
                    My best contact yet was 50 miles on a cheap 5 Watt Baofeng VHF radio using the national simplex frequency 146.520 MHz.

                    For my freshman year of college I attended the University of Arizona but I decided
                    I wanted a change of scenery and transferred to Cornell. During my time as a physics undergraduate,
                    I learned lots of math, logic, and thinking skills that help me to not only solve
                    problems related to physics, but also deconstruct and re-organize my thoughts in a manner
                    conducive to help me in my day-to-day life as a programmer.

                <p>
                    The Oregon Coast is one of my favorite places on Earth. Every time I go back to Oregon I like to be able to walk on the beach and 
                    see all the ocean life that washes up on shore. Outside of work, I love getting out to go on hikes or lift weights. The most 
                    I've ever walked in a day was 50,000 steps. My best over head press, bench press, squat, and deadlift are 1, 2, 3, and 4 plates resepectively.
