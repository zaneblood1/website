                <p>
                    Although I was born in Hawaii, I grew up in Ashland, Oregon where I 
                    attended Ashland High School and began to foster my love for all things
                    science. Back then I was just getting interested in hardware and experiment and built
                    a few home projects from scratch like a Tesla coil and a Hoffman Apparatus. Videos of
                    these experiments can be found on the older uploads of my YouTube channel.

                <p>
                    For my freshman year of college I attended the University of Arizona but I decided
                    I wanted a change of scenery and transferred to Cornell. During my time as a physics undergaraduate,
                    I learned lots of math, logic, and thinking skills that help me to not only solve
                    problems related to physics, but also deconstruct and re-organize my thoughts in a manner
                    conducive to help me in my day-to-day life as a programmer.
