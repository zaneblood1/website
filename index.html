                <p>
                    Welcome to the personal website of Zane Blood! I graduated in 2023 with a bachelor's degree in physics from the College of Arts
                    and Sciences at Cornell Universiy in Ithaca, New York. As an undergraduate, I mainly worked in an experimental accelerator
                    physics laboratory designing and machining parts for our group's table top accelerator used for ultrafast electron
                    diffraction experiments. After graduating, I worked for 2 years as a fullstack software developer at Epic Systems in Verona, Wisconsin. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Starting in September 2025, I will begin my PhD in physics at the California Institute of Technology. I am interested in 
                    computational physics and using computers to create simulations of physical systems. I hope to pursue these interests of mine 
                    during my graduate education and onwards. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I primarily use this site as a testing grounds for basic front end web development
                    with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. In the future, I plan to add a SQL backend and turn this into a fullstack project. In the meantime,
                    this webpage mainly just serves as a gallery for some of my favorite programming and physics projects I have worked on. 
                    Please feel free to contact me! Links to my GitHub repositories, YouTube channel, 
                    and LinkedIn can be found at the banner at the bottom of this site.
