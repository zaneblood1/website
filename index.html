                Welcome to the personal website of Zane Blood! I graduated in 2023 with a bachelor's degree in physics from the College of Arts
                and Sciences at Cornell Universiy in Ithaca, New York. As an undergraduate, I mainly worked in an experimental accelerator
                physics laboratory designing and machining parts for our group's table top accelerator used for ultrafast electron
                diffraction experiments. After graduating, I worked for 2 years as a fullstack software developer at Epic Systems in Verona, Wisconsin. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Starting in September 2025, I will begin my PhD in physics at the California Institute of Technology. I am interested in 
                computational physics and using computers to create simulations of dynamical systems. In addition to solving equations with
                the aid of a computer, I also like computer science in its own right, and I am always trying to follow the fundamental principles of software
                engineering whenever I write my own code. I hope to learn more during my PhD about solving physical systems both via brute force deterministic methods
                with the help of high performance computing and "learning" systems through M.L. and other data science techniques.
            </p>

                I primarily use this site as a testing grounds for basic front end web development
                with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. In the future, I plan to add a SQL backend and turn this into a fullstack project. In the meantime,
                this webpage mainly just serves as a gallery for some of my favorite programming and physics projects I have worked on. 
                Please feel free to contact me! Links to my GitHub repositories, YouTube channel, 
                and LinkedIn can be found at the banner at the bottom of this site.
