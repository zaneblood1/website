                        The following page contains a gallery of some of the personal programming projects I have worked on in the past.
                        A lot of these projects are animations of dynamical systems like Conway's Game of Life (shown above) which evolve 
                        through time according to a certain set of rules given a collection of initial conditions. These dynamical systems are 
                        very visually beautiful, and they are what got me interested in pursuing a graduate education in computational
                        physics myself. If you want to download the code for any of these animations yourself, click on the big download
                        button next to each GIF, and start tinkering around with it. All of these animations are also available on my YouTube channel
                        as well, often with longer length run-throughs.

                        The above animation shows one of two simulations I wrote for my senior physics lab at Cornell. What you are looking at is a quantum billiards simulation in 2 dimensions. 
                        A Gaussian pulse is sent toward the upper right corner with an initial 45 degree velocity and then bounces back and starts interacting with itself
                        creating a bunch of interesting interference patterns. It took almost 4 hours to get the data for this 2-D wave packet simulation, but in my opinion 
                        it was well worth it. I think its beautiful watching the trapped particle oscillate through different modes, and it's one of my favorite simulatons I have
                        ever done. These animations were created using the Crank-Nicholson method and written in Jupyter Notebooks. The full YouTube video for this project
                        also shows a 1-D wave packet tunneling through an infinite potential barrier, illustrating how certain quantum scenarios can lead to unexpected behavior.

                        The Boid algorithm simulates flocking behavior of birds or insects. The system exhibits cohesion 
                        (birds try to stay near their neighbors), alignment (birds align their velocities towards the 
                        average velocity of the birds around them), and dispersion (birds cannot get too close to each other). I was inspired by
                        the Coding Train's video on the algoritm, and took his 2D code and reworked it to function in 3D. In the future I would like to 
                        take the point particle representations of these "Birds" and give them a head and body as well as non-zero volume.

                    <p>
                        In this demo, I wrote a script in Processing that visualizes some common and some less common but still
                        interesting sorting algorithms. A lot was learned in this process, particularly the difficulty of animating
                        recursive versus iterative algorithms. For those that are recursive, it turns out that one will need to implement
                        a multi-threaded approach in the animating code. My favorite algorithm here is the "Cocktail Shaker Sort". After watching
                        the video I think it is clear to see why it was given its name. The full YouTube video for this animation more clearly labels
                        which algorithm is which for those that would like to learn more.

                    <p>
                        Another purely CS-based project and a logical follow-up to the Sorting Algorithms project, I decided
                        to animate some common searching algorithms in Processing. I think my favorite is the breadth first
                        search priority queue as the logic is relatively simple to understand and something one might think of 
                        right off the bat when designing a searching algorithm from scratch. However, the most visually appealing 
                        is Dijkstra's as we animate both the BFS stage and the final path of least resistance. The shuffle button was
                        a cool little feature of this project so that each shuffle created a new map. Like with Conway's Game of Life,
                        I would like to add user input into this project so that anyone could create their own custom maps.

                        The last project listed here animates the famous Lorenz Attractor. The set of Lorenz Equations are related to a model of the weather and they
                        are a chaotic system. This is what brought the butterfly effect into mainstream popular science. This set of equations represents a chaotic system. There are 
                        a few different ways to define a chaotic system, but some common attributes are that they never diverge to infinity, they never revisit the same location,
                        and an initially small disturbance in starting conditions can lead to wildly different outcomes over just a few time steps. There are a lot more
                        animations of the Lorenz Attractor on my YouTube channel which show different cross sections and other effects like the fast divergence of close
                        initial conditions.
