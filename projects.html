                    Conway's Game of Life is a zero player game where the result at any time step is determined
                    by the initial conditions and the dynamics of the game. This game simulates living systems
                    where each cell either lives, dies, or regrows based on the resources around it. In this simulation
                    we have the famous Gosper Glider that will go on indefintely. This code was written in Jupyter Notebooks
                    and the animation done with Matplotlib.

                    The Boid algorithm simulates flocking behavior of birds or insects. The system exhibits cohesion 
                    (birds try to stay near their neighbors), alignment (birds align their velocities towards the 
                    average velocity of the birds around them), and dispersion (birds cannot get too close to each other).

                    In this demo, I wrote a script in Processing that visualizes some common and some less common but still
                    interesting sorting algorithms. A lot was learned in this process, particularly the difficulty of animating
                    recursive versus iterative algorithms. For those that are recursive, it turns out that one will need to implement
                    a multi-threaded approach in the animating code.

                <p>
                    Another purely CS-based project and a logical follow-up to the Sorting Algorithms project, I decided
                    to animate some common searching algorithms in Processing. I think my favorite is the breadth first
                    search priority queue as the logic is relatively simple to understand and something one might think of 
                    right off the bat when designing a searching algorithm from scratch. However, the most visually appealing 
                    is Dijkstra's as we animate both the BFS stage and the final path of least resistance.

                    The last project listed here animates the famous Lorenz Attractor. The set of Lorenz Equations are related to a model of the weather and they
                    are a chaotic system. This is what brought the butterfly effect into mainstream popular science.
